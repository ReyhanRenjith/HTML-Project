I am Reyhan Renjith Mangattu, my portfolio website starts with a clean page which has my name on it
Upon clicking "view", you will be directed to the main page which has an introduction, my picture and also my skills.
On top of the main page, the navigation bar is given.
The LinkedIn and Instagram on the navigation bar will guide you to my respective linkedIn and Instagram profiles.
The Projects page showcases my previous projects which i have taken a part of and also the projects which I am currently working on. I hope to continue updating my portfolio website as I make further progress in my ongoing projects.
The Contact page contains information on how to contact me.
All these codes have been written by me and i have just used the internet to understand and implement how the navigation bar works. None of my code is copied from any other source.
I have also ensured that my page is responsive. I tested it on multiple smartphones.
